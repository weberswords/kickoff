# Kickoff

A Python script for updating Brew, npm, and pip and starting the apps and websites I use most.

Be sure to make the script executable.
To run:
`./get_started.py [args]`

default without any args will open all non-work/school apps and sites
`--apps: only open non-work/school apps`
`--sites: only open non-work/school sites`
`--update: do updates`
`--work: also open work/school-related things`
